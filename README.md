andy-wants-to-travel


The goal is for Andy to write a website that tells him where he should go. This is based on the premise that the USA is a diverse country where each state has their own unique attributes that are similarly diverse as the EU.

Goals:
* I want a map of the country that tells me everything I could do in that state that feels special to that state.
* I don't want to have to crawl through data to manually populate this myself. This site will have a component that webcrawls for me.
* I want to have some way that best packs efficiency for my buck and places nearby destinations together that would be appropriate for like a day/half-day trip to suggest individual destinations to travel to, ex: suggest an itinerary for a weekend
